# Development

To get started developing Yarn locally:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:yarnjs/yarn.git
cd yarn
npm install
```

From there you're good to go!

Easiest way to add/modify/test features is by writing a test and then interacting with Yarn through there.

You can start mocha in watch mode and then begin coding:

```shell
npm run test:unit -- --watch
```
